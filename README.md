MultiTranslateAPI is a multilingual translation RESTful API. It's developed with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to manage and query a database of English words and their translations in multiple languages. The application contains endpoints for querying and managing the database with three main entities: Categories, Words, and Translations.

## Data Model

- **Categories**: This entity represents a category of words.
- **Words**: This entity represents an English word and its associated category.
- **Translations**: This entity represents a translation of a word into another language.

Please note: The SQLite database used by this API is generated by another project, [MultiTranslate](https://github.com/edErikson/MultiTranslate). Refer to that project for details on how the database is created.

## Setup

### Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic

To install these dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


The application uses SQLite for the database and SQLAlchemy for the ORM. You can set up the database connection by updating the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` in `database.py`.

## Running the App

To run the application, use the command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload


API Endpoints
'GET /word/{word_id}: Returns the details of a word, given its ID.
'GET /word/{word}/translations: Returns all translations of a specific English word.
'GET /category/{category_id}/words: Returns all words from a specific category, given its ID.
'GET /translation/{translation_id}: Returns the details of a translation, given its ID.
